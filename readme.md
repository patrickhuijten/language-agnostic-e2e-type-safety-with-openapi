# Talk - Language agnostic E2E type safety with OpenAPI

This repository contains the source for a public talk I gave at Advanced JS meetup Amsterdam on September 20 2023.

## Software used

In this repository you will find source files for a next.js app router project on the UI and a Kotlin Spring starter project for the server.

OpenAPI generator is used to facilitate the communication between UI and server, by generating a fully (typescript) typed SDK for the UI and API models & controllers for the back-end.
